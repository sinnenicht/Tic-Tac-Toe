# Tic-Tac-Toe

A basic two-player tic-tac-toe game.

Prerequisites
-------------

This program requires Java to compile and run.

Installation
------------

1. Download this repository and unzip the .zip file in your desired location.
2. Using the command line, navigate to \Tic-Tac-Toe-master\src\tictactoe.
3. Compile the program using the command `javac Main.java`.

Usage
-----

Once the program has been compiled, it can be run from the command line by navigating to \Tic-Tac-Toe-master\src and using the command `java tictactoe.Main`.

The game starts with an empty board and on X's turn. The user will be prompted to enter coordinates. The game board's coordinates are as such:

(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)

(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)

(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

Coordinates should be entered as two integers with a space between them, e.g. `1 3`.

The game will end when either X or O has occupied three spaces in a row or when all of the board's spaces are filled.
